# Welcome to QubesOS // Start Hear.

## TL:DR // ELI5
### What is Qubes OS?
#### QubesOS is like **apartment building that you own** each room is seperate the apartment rooms based on what you need. for example:
  - apartments for **Banking**
  - apartments for **Work**
  - apartments for **Personal** &c.

#### With each apartments have rooms and each apartments in the apartment complex have a small studio appartment (e.g. StandaloneVM) while others have multiple of room (e.g. Templates.)
This rooms (apps): individual applications that are *inside* the apartment, exmaple include
  - The **Banking** aparment haves the **Firefox Bowser** room and the **Folder** room
  - The **Work** apartment haves the **Edge Browser,** three **Work Apps** and a **Folder**
  - The **Personal** apartment have have the **Brave Bowser,** two **Personal apps** and you personal **Folder**

#### While the Templates are great, what if you need to run a separt OS (Linux, Unix, Windows, &c.,)?
That where ***StandaloneVM*** comefrom.

In StandaloneVM (or just Standalones) you can creat stand alone verical machines (OS on a OS) on your operating system that is separate from you templates.
You can run any Linux Distros, non-Linux operating systems, older operating systems like system 7, and Windows operating system like 10, 8, 7, or XP & Vista.

  Note there are Windows Template (WTQ) but there heard to run and on going. If you like I am working on "WinQubes" and QTW to run on QubesOS.

### Templates Vs. Standalones
Standard apartments share a *Template* to save space while Standalones are as Studio apartments as *templates* are Multi-room Apartments; they are **fully independent** and have their own files and system settings, &c. They are heavier on the building's resources, but thet give you total control of there one-room apartment.
